            Hi! I’m Jasmine, a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC), with a strong interest in building reliable, scalable software.
            This summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn, working on full-stack premium verifications features for company pages. Previously, I’ve built full-stack, AI-powered applications at a speech tech startup and multimedia content creation tools at Serato, a DJ tech company. I enjoy tackling hard engineering problems and optimizing systems that have measurable impact.
            I do my best work in fast-paced, intellectually rigorous environments where I can apply my software engineering skills to solve challenging problems with real-world impact.
            </p>
