                Hi! I'm Jasmine, a rising junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC) passionate about building products at the intersection of technology, creativity, and social impact.
                This summer, I am interning at LinkedIn as a software engineer. Previously, I've developed apps and softwares at a speech therapy startup helping children with speech disorders and at a DJ tech company empowering music creators. I love exploring how engineering can empower human connection and self-expression.
